      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a frontend developer with a strong technical foundation in{" "}
        <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b>, <b>JavaScript (ES6)</b>, <b>TypeScript</b>,
        and <b>React</b> – including <b>JSX</b> and <b>React Hooks</b> – paired
        with a background in UX design that gives me a keen eye for visual
        detail and user experience. <br /> <br />I build responsive, accessible,
        and high-performing interfaces using modern tools and best practices. My
        experience also includes <b>Node.js</b> for backend integration, version
        control with <b>GitHub</b>, and a strong focus on{" "}
        <b>WCAG-compliant accessibility</b> and <b>responsive design</b>. <br />
        <br />
        With the ability to navigate both design and development, I thrive in
        cross-functional teams where I can bridge the gap between concept and
        code – ensuring that the final product is not only functional, but also
        user-centered and visually refined. <br /> <br />
        Looking for someone who can code with precision, think like a designer,
        and speak both Figma and JavaScript? Let’s connect!
